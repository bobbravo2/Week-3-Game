# Week-3-Game

Candy Collector

A random number value between 1 and 120 is shown and your objective of this game is to reach that value by clicking on one of the 4 images of candy.

Each image has a different value so try to calculate correctly to get to the value shown initially when the game started. If you reach the value then you Win and the Wins counter goes up.

If you go past the number you will lose and the game will restart. The candies will have different number values and the counters will go back down to 0. Have fun!
